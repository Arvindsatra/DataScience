# Bio-Signal Analysis for Smoking:
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), one-hot
encoding, and feature selection for smoking-related data.
Utilized advanced machine learning algorithms for pattern
extraction and predicting smoking behaviors.

# Walmart:
Developed sales prediction models using regression
techniques and advanced feature engineering.
Identified customer churn factors and improved predictions
using supervised learning algorithms.

# Credit Card Fraud Detection:
Applied supervised learning algorithms (e.g., logistic
regression, decision tree) for fraud detection in credit card
transactions. Utilized data mining and statistical techniques
for analysis.

# Flight Booking:
Analyzed flight booking data using EDA, statistical methods,
and machine learning algorithms. Explored price variations,
ticket purchase timing, and airline popularity.

# Customer Churn:
Performed data manipulation and visualization. Created
decision tree and random forest models for churn prediction.
